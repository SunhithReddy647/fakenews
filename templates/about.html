            <h1>About Our Mission</h1>
            <p>We are dedicated to combating the spread of misinformation. Our fake news detector is a powerful tool that leverages cutting-edge machine learning to provide users with a reliable way to assess the credibility of news articles. We believe in a more informed public, and this project is our contribution to that cause.</p>
            
            <h2>The Technology</h2>
            <p>The core of our detector is a <strong>Random Forest Classifier</strong>, a robust machine learning model known for its accuracy. The model has been trained on a comprehensive dataset containing thousands of both real and fake news articles. The text is processed using a <strong>TF-IDF Vectorizer</strong>, which converts the words into a numerical format that the model can understand.</p>
            
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>When you submit an article, it goes through the same preprocessing pipeline as the training data. The TF-IDF Vectorizer transforms the text, and then the Random Forest model makes a prediction based on the patterns it learned during training. The result is a simple, clear indication of whether the article is likely to be real or fake.</p>
